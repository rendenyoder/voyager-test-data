      <abstract>
This dataset is one from a series of transportation layers derived
from the US Census Bureau Tiger 2K (June 7, 2002 Version) information.
All the layers are statewide and are arranged by their major Census
Feature Class Code (CFCC).  All data layers are reprojected into the
CaSIL standard projection, and only a small subset of the attribution
is included.  Zip Code, and address information is NOT included.

CaSIL has divided these transportation layers to help users choose the
appropriate level of detail for their project.

Users requiring further TIGER information, are encouraged to use the
native TIGER files (also on CaSIL) or directly from the Census Bureau.

The following transportation layers are included in the series:

us_highways - CFCC A11-A28 - 6 [Mb]

Primary Highway With Limited Access Interstate highways and some toll
highways are in this category (A1) and are distinguished by the
presence of interchanges.

Primary Road Without Limited Access This category (A2) includes
nationally and regionally important highways that do not have limited
access as required by category A1. It consists mainly of US highways,
but may include some state highways and county highways that connect
cities and larger towns.


state_highways - CFCC A31-A38 - 10[Mb]

Secondary and Connecting Road This category (A3) includes mostly state
highways, but may include some county highways that connect smaller
towns, subdivisions, and neighborhoods.

local_roads - CFCC A41-A48 - 340[Mb]

Local, Neighborhood, and Rural Road A road in this category (A4) is
used for local traffic and usually has a single lane of traffic in
each direction. In an urban area, this is a neighborhood road and
street that is not a thorough-fare belonging in categories A2 or
A3. In a rural area, this is a short-distance road connecting the
smallest towns; the road may or may not have a state or county route
number.

vehicular_trails - CFCC A51-A58 - 7[Mb]

Vehicular Trail A road in this category (A5) is usable only by
four-wheel drive vehicles, is usually a one-lane dirt trail, and is
found almost exclu-sively in very rural areas.

other_thoroughfare - CFCC A61-A78 - 15[Mb]

Road with Special Characteristics This category (A6) includes roads,
portions of a road, intersections of a road, or the ends of a road
that are parts of the vehicular highway system and have separately
identifiable characteristics.

Road as Other Thoroughfare A road in this category (A7) is not part of
the vehicular highway system. It is used by bicyclists or pedestrians,
and is typically inaccessible to mainstream motor traffic except for
private-owner and service vehicles. This category includes foot and
hiking trails located on park and forest land, as well as stairs or
walkways that follow a road right-of-way and have names similar to
road names.

railroad - CFCC B?? - 6[Mb]

Railroad Main Line A railroad in this category is the primary track
that provides service between destinations. A main line track often
carries the name of the owning and operating railroad company.

Railroad Spur A railroad in this category is the track that leaves the
main track, ending in an industrial park, factory, or warehouse area,
or forming a siding along the main track.

Railroad Yard A railroad yard track has parallel tracks that form a
working area for the railroad company. Train cars and engines are
repaired, switched, and dispatched from a yard.

Railroad with Special Characteristics A railroad or portions of a
rail- road track that are parts of the railroad system and have
separately identifiable characteristics.

<purpose>
	These data are intended for geographic display and analysis for California.
	They should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for
	1:100,000-scale data.
</purpose>
<supplinf>This dataset has been made available thru the California
      Spatial Information Library URL:http://gis.ca.gov.  They have
      been subsetted to California, and reprojected into a common
      statewide projection.

<update>
TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER database when
needed for geographic programs required to support the census and
survey programs of the U.S. Census Bureau.  No changes or updates
will be made to the UA Census 2000 TIGER/Line files.  Future releases
of TIGER/Line files will reflect updates made to the Census TIGER
database and will be released under a version numbering system
based on the month and year the data is extracted.

Data completeness of the TIGER/Line files reflects the contents of the

version) were created.

<horizpar>
The information present in these files is provided for the purposes
of statistical analysis and census operations only.  Coordinates
in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but
the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as
the six decimal places suggest.  The positional accuracy varies
with the source materials used, but generally the information is
no better than the established national map Accuracy standards
for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS);
thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications
such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses
that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth&apos;s
surface.  The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy
standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum,
1983.
