         colonial population. The English army found that fighting an enemy in the near-wilderness of North America was too much for their massed
         regiments. The dense forests and mountainous terrain required fighting men who knew the habits of the enemy and could serve effectively as
         scouts and skirmishers .</pubs:Para>

            subject to the rules and articles of war; to appear at roll- call every evening, on their own parade, equipped, each with a Firelock,
            sixty rounds of powder and ball, and a hatchet, at which time an officer from each company is to inspect the same, to see they are in
            order, so as to be ready on any emergency to march at a minute's warning; and before they are dismissed, the necessary guards are to be
            draughted, and scouts for the next day appointed.</pubs:ListItem>

            ordered out to the enemies forts or frontiers for discoveries, if your number be small, march in a single file, keeping at such a distance
            from each other as to prevent one shot from killing two men, sending one man, or more, forward, and the like on each side, at the distance
            of twenty yards from the main body, if the ground you march over will admit of it, to give the signal to the officer of the approach of an
            enemy, and of their number, &amp;c.</pubs:ListItem>

            marshes or soft ground, change your position, and march abreast of each other to prevent the enemy from tracking you (as they would do if
            you marched in a single file) till you get over such ground, and then resume your former order, and march till it is quite dark before you
            encamp, which do, if possible, on a piece of ground which that may afford your centries the advantage of seeing or hearing the enemy some
            considerable distance, keeping one half of your whole party awake alternately through the night.</pubs:ListItem>

            come to the place you would reconnoitre, make a stand, and send one or two men in whom you can confide, to look out the best ground for
            making your observations.</pubs:ListItem>

            fortune to take any prisoners, keep them separate, till they are examined, and in your return take a different route from that in which
            you went out, that you may the better discover any party in your rear, and have an opportunity, if their strength be superior to yours, to
            alter your course, or disperse, as circumstances may require.</pubs:ListItem>

            body of three or four hundred, with a design to attack the enemy, divide your party into three columns, each headed by a proper officer,
            and let those columns march in single files, the columns to the right and left keeping at twenty yards distance or more from that of the
            center, if the ground will admit, and let proper guards be kept in the front and rear, and suitable flanking parties at a due distance as
            before directed, with orders to halt on all eminences, to take a view of the surrounding ground, to prevent your being ambuscaded, and to
            notify the approach or retreat of the enemy, that proper dispositions may be made for attacking, defending, &amp;c. And if the enemy
            approach in your front on level ground, form a front of your three columns or main body with the advanced guard, keeping out your flanking
            parties, as if you were marching under the command of trusty officers, to prevent the enemy from pressing hard on either of your wings, or
            surrounding you, which is the usual method of the savages, if their number will admit of it, and be careful likewise to support and
            strengthen your rear-guard.</pubs:ListItem>

            receive the enemy's fire, fall, or squat down, till it is over; then rise and discharge at them. If their main body is equal to yours,
            extend yourselves occasionally; but if superior, be careful to support and strengthen your flanking parties, to make them equal to theirs,
            that if possible you may repulse them to their main body, in which case push upon them with the greatest resolution with equal force in
            each flank and in the center, observing to keep at a due distance from each other, and advance from tree to tree, with one half of the
            party before the other ten or twelve yards. If the enemy push upon you, let your front fire and fall down, and then let your rear advance
            thro' them and do the like, by which time those who before were in front will be ready to discharge again, and repeat the same
            alternately, as occasion shall require; by this means you will keep up such a constant fire, that the enemy will not be able easily to
            break your order, or gain your ground.</pubs:ListItem>

            to retreat, be careful, in your pursuit of them, to keep out your flanking parties, and prevent them from gaining eminences, or rising
            grounds, in which case they would perhaps be able to rally and repulse you in their turn.</pubs:ListItem>

            retreat, let the front of your whole party fire and fall back, till the rear hath done the same, making for the best ground you can; by
            this means you will oblige the enemy to pursue you, if they do it at all, in the face of a constant fire.</pubs:ListItem>

            superior that you are in danger of being surrounded by them, let the whole body disperse, and every one take a different road to the place
            of rendezvous appointed for that evening, which must every morning be altered and fixed for the evening ensuing, in order to bring the
            whole party, or as many of them as possible, together, after any separation that may happen in the day; but if you should happen to be
            actually surrounded, form yourselves into a square, or if in the woods, a circle is best, and, if possible, make a stand till the darkness
            of the night favours your escape.</pubs:ListItem>

                        ism:ownerProducer="USA">List Item: If your rear is
            attacked, the main body and flankers must face about to the right or left, as occasion shall require, and form themselves to oppose the
            enemy, as before directed; and the same method must be observed, if attacked in either of your flanks, by which means you will always make
            a rear of one of your flank-guards.</pubs:ListItem>

            rally after a retreat, in order to make a fresh stand against the enemy, by all means endeavour to do it on the most rising ground you
            come at, which will give you greatly the advantage in point of situation, and enable you to repulse superior numbers.</pubs:ListItem>

            upon by the enemy, reserve your fire till they approach very near, which will then put them into the greatest surprize and consternation,
            and give you an opportunity of rushing upon them with your hatchets and cutlasses to the better advantage.</pubs:ListItem>

            night, fix your centries in such a manner as not to be relieved from the main body till morning, profound secrecy and silence being often
            of the last importance in these cases. Each centry therefore should consist of six men, two of whom must be constantly alert, and when
            relieved by their fellows, it should be done without noise; and in case those on duty see or hear any thing, which alarms them, they are
            not to speak, but one of them is silently to retreat, and acquaint the commanding officer thereof, that proper dispositions may be made;
            and all occasional centries should be fixed in like manner.</pubs:ListItem>

            day, awake your whole detachment; that being the time when the savages the savages chuse to fall upon their enemies, you should by all
            means be in readiness to receive them.</pubs:ListItem>

            discovered by your detachments in the morning, and their numbers are superior to yours, and a victory doubtful, you should not attack them
            till the evening, as then they will not know your numbers, and if you are repulsed, your retreat will be favoured by the darkness of the
            night.</pubs:ListItem>

            during the night.</pubs:ListItem>

            at a due distance, and let a small party waylay the path you came in, lest the enemy should be pursuing.</pubs:ListItem>

            pursue your intended route by night; and whether you go by land or water, give out parole and countersigns, in order to know one another
            in the dark, and likewise appoint a station every man to repair to, in case of any accident that may separate you."</pubs:ListItem>
