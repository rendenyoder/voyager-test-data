This folder should be a *small* dataset.  (could be much smaller!)

We need unit tests to make sure we detect various files correctly, including:

 * simple files (.pdf)
 * simple files with attached .xml files  (file.pdf with file.pdf.xml)
 * xml files that are not 'attached metadata'
 * geodatabases  (.gdb folder)


See: InArcCatalog.png for how this folder shows up in ArcCatalog

We are still missing an example for:
  INFO/ARCDR9 >> ArcInfo Workspace
  dbCache.dat.index  >> Google Cache?  perhaps check the magic number on this one?
